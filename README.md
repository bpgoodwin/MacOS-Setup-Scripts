# MacOS-Setup-Scripts (W.I.P)
A set of scripts to quickly setup a standardised development environment. This is a continuous project, with tools being added and removed as I use them. 

In general, these setup scripts would be a good place to start for those experimenting with Data Science and Software Engineering, with many modern and popular technologies (note that not all of the scripts may be nessasary for you).
